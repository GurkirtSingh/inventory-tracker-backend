## How to use APIs
This web app provides basic CRUD opertaion on the inventory items in the form of APIs. There is a live version of it currently hosted on [Replit](https://replit.com/) at [Inventory Tracker Backend](https://replit.com/@GurkirtSingh/inventory-tracker-backend#.replit). Below is explanation on how the APIs work./

Every http request that perform operation on items needs to be sent at `url:port/item` and likewise for warehouse operations it needs to be at `url:port/warehouse`
